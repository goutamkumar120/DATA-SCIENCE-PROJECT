# DATA-SCIENCE-PROJECT
Project name:" FAKE NEWS DETECTION using MACHINE LEARNING & DEEP LEARNING "

[Training Dataset link]{https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data?select=train.csv}


[Testing Dataset link]{https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data?select=test.csv}

1. The data we used in our work is collected from kaggle and 
   contains news articles from various domains to cover most of the news 
   rather than specifically classifying political news.

2. The primary aim of the research is to identify patterns in text that 
   differentiate fake articles from true news. 

3. We extracted different textual features from the articles 
   using Natural language tool and used the feature set as an input to the models. 

4. The learning models were trained and parameter-tuned to obtain optimal accuracy. 
   Some models have achieved comparatively higher accuracy than others. 

5. We used multiple performance metrics to compare the results for each algorithm.
 
6. The ensemble learners have shown an overall better score on all performance metrics
   as compared to the individual learners.
